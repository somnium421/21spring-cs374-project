----
This project helps to plan meeting with family and participe in the meeting. You don't have to download any additional file to run this project. Also we recommed you to open it with ```Chrome```. And we usually used the same names for ```.js``` files to ```.html``` files.

Our main tasks are usually implemented in ```create-new-meeting.html```, ```participate.html```, ```result.html```, and connected ```.js``` files.

- ```create-new-meeting.html``` : You can create a meeting with several options (place, activity, time, public/private, and etc).
- ```participate.html``` : You can suggest your opinions to joinable meetings. 
- ```result.html``` : You can see the result of opinions of other family members, and write comments to make an optimal plan.
